## 1st Assignment Description
This Assignment is about the Bridge Crossing Problem. It was asked to implement a program in Java or C++ and use an AI algorithm to solve it. Our team implemented the A* algorithm with closed set. So given a number of people that want to cross the bridge, our algorithm must find the optimal solution, meaning the minimum time for all people to pass across. More info about the rules of the game and what was exactly requested [here](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/Artificial-Intelligence-2020-2021-AUEB/blob/main/1st%20Assignment/assignment%20announcement-report/project-announcement.pdf). More details about our solution, algorithm implementation and code analysis [here](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/Artificial-Intelligence-2020-2021-AUEB/blob/main/1st%20Assignment/assignment%20announcement-report/project-report.pdf).

## Execution
After you've downloaded locally this repository, you can either execute Main.java in cmd/terminal or in an IDE of your choice like Intellij or Eclipse. In both scenarios all java files located in the src folder must be in the same directory. Below an example of how to run the program in cmd/terminal is shown.


#### Change directory
```properties
cd "Directory where the src folder is located"
```  

#### Compile Main.java
```console
javac Main.java
```

#### Run Main
```console
java Main
```
