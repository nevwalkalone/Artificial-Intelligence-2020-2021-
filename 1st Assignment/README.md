## Bridge and Torch
This Assignment is about the Bridge and Torch problem. It was asked to implement a program in Java or C++ and use an AI algorithm to solve it. Our team implemented the A* algorithm with closed set in **Java** language. So given a number of people that want to cross the bridge, our algorithm must find the optimal solution, meaning the minimum time for all people to pass across. It is highly suggested that you read about the rules of the game and what exactly was requested [here](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/Artificial-Intelligence-2020-2021-AUEB/blob/main/1st%20Assignment/assignment%20announcement-report/project-announcement.pdf), before you proceed. More details about our solution, algorithm implementation and code analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/Artificial-Intelligence-2020-2021-AUEB/blob/main/1st%20Assignment/assignment%20announcement-report/project-report.pdf).

## Execution
After you've downloaded locally this repository, you can either execute Main.java in cmd/terminal or in an IDE of your choice like Intellij or Eclipse. In both scenarios all java files located in the src folder must be in the same directory. Below an example of how to run the program in cmd/terminal is shown.


### Change directory
```properties
cd "Directory where the src folder is located"
```  

### Compile Main.java
```console
javac Main.java
```

### Run Main
```console
java Main
```
When the program runs, the user is asked to give as an input the number of family members that must cross the bridge, the total time limit that must not be exceeded as well as the amount of time that is required for each member to cross from one side to the other. For this example let's go with 5 people, and 1,3,6,8,12 times for each member respectively. Total time limit will be 30 seconds, so the algorithm must find a solution in 30 seconds or under.
