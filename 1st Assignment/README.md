## 1st Assignment Description
This Assignment is about the Bridge Crossing Problem. It was asked to implement a program in Java or C++ and use an AI algorithm to solve it. Our team implemented the A* algorithm with closed set. So given a number of people that want to cross the bridge, our algorithm must find the optimal solution, meaning the minimum time for all people to pass across. More info about the rules of the game and what was exactly requested here. More details about our solution, algorithm implementation and code analysis here.
